    <h2>CANADA</h2>
    <p>Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend 
        from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, 
        covering over 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), 
        making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border 
        with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest 
        binational land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan 
        areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

        Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. 
        Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along 
        the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its 
        colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American 
        colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. 
        This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from 
        the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 
        and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the 
        Parliament of the United Kingdom. </p>
