    <h2>ITALY</h2>
    <p>During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and 
       the Barbarian Invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous city-states and maritime republics, 
       mostly in the North, became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the 
       groundwork for modern capitalism. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest 
       of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art. 
       During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and 
       the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. However, centuries of rivalry 
       and infighting between the Italian city-states, and the invasions of other European powers during 
       the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically fragmented.
       Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries 
       with the decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade routes that 
       bypassed the Mediterranean.</p>
